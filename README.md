## Project Background
The demand for data science professionals is rapidly increasing, and LinkedIn serves as a major platform for connecting job seekers with opportunities in this domain. However, the vast amount of job postings makes it challenging to extract actionable insights.

Thus, to provide the best simplicity and easiness for job-seekers, we tried several models including open-source LLM or locally trained models to perform the task of summarization. By comparing different model performance based on selected metrics and also their trade-offs, we may choose to apply them in diffeent contexts if possible.

## [Dataset Overview](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asaniczka/data-scientist-linkedin-job-postings)
In today's dynamic job market, understanding the skills and qualifications that employers are seeking is paramount for job seekers, recruiters, and policymakers alike. With the exponential growth of job postings across various industries, extracting meaningful insights from this vast amount of data can be challenging. To address this, we leverage different technique to distill key trends and patterns from job posting datasets. This dataset includes columns such as job titles, job locations, company names, skills required, salary, job level, and job summary etc.
